# Courseware as Code site template

This repository contains a template for **Courseware as Code** generating a static website using Jekyll that can be deployed to Gitlab Pages for free.
Its main objective is to make hosting educational content as easy as possible.

This project started out as a fork of the amazing Jekyll template (just-the-docs)[https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/]. Courseware as Code wouldn't be possible without it.

[See it in action!](https://courseware-as-code.gitlab.io/courseware-template/)
