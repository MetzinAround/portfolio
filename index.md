# Pj Metz: Energetic and Empathetic DevRel

Thank you for visiting my portfolio! 

I spent 11 years as an educator working mostly in high school literature courses. I taught standard, honors, and AP courses for  9-12th grades and loved showing students something they had never known. I was a guide for he unfamiliar and a conduit through which information and skills could grow. My expereince as a teacher has greatly shaped my new career: Developer Relations. 

It's important to understand developers in order to work with them; they need someone who can empathize and understand what they are working towards. With that in mind, I make sure first to understand the product I'm working with and then to understand the developers who use the product. In that way, I can work with the developers to find a solution, rather than pushing a solution that doesn't matter to them. d

I am energetic, passionate, and a team player. I take on work that propels the team forward and work to create an environment of trust and authenticity with my team and outside stakeholders. I'm excited you've come to my portfolio. Here you'll find [blogs](), [videos](), [live streams](), and [content]() I made in the past 1.5 years as an Education Evangelist at GitLab.
