# Lesson Plans, Enablement, and Instruction
A large part of the work I did at GitLab was to enable educators and students to learn to use GitLab, and this included writing and delivering lectures and workshops in classrooms or at Association of Computing Machinery conferences. Recently, I created a 5 week lesson plan about DevOps and GitLab designed to be dropped into any applicable course. While this isn't something that every job would want, I believe that education happens consistently throughout a career, and some of these materials are useful just the same to working developers and other stakeholders. 

## Lesson Plans

This [GitLab group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-and-devops-5-week-course) contains a fork of the 5 week module I created for use in the classroom. It contains 9 lectures, three articles with discussion prompts, and 10 assignments labeled as homework or classwork. While meant as a drop in, any educator would need to check the material and mold it to their own needs before using it in their classroom. The lectures cover security, the WebIDE, issues, CI/CD and more. 

## Examples of Classroom uses for GitLab
These repos are a few examples of how you can set up a classroom using GitLab. One uses GitLab pages to create a [static site](https://gitlab.com/MetzinAround/metzin-around-university-frontend-style) for students to find lectures and work, and the other is using a [GitLab Group](https://gitlab.com/devops-education/workshops/examples/metzinaround-college-of-computer-science) to keep the classes organized. 

## Workshops

My manager tasked me with creating several workshops for students and educators. I created one for early Python users where we would make a magic 8-ball using python functions. Another was using the Twitter API to make Twitter bots. Finally, we also created one to guide educators in making their first GitLab issue to practice skills they'd need to teach their students. All workshops were offered asynchronously as well as live over zoom or in person for students at schools like Georgetown and Cal Poly Pomona. Click the image to see more of these repos. If there is a static site associated with it, the link is in the description of the repo.
