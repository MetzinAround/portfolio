git is a *free* and *open source* distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like **Subversion**, **CVS**, **Perforce**, and **ClearCase** with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.
