# Twitch 
I started livestreaming on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/metzinaround) while I was still learning to code. I worked on learning C# basics from Codecademy and did it live in front of the whole internet and later building a .net core website and Twitter bots with my mentors. I designed intro and outro videos, and did my best to create an environment that was entertaining and informative. I continued to stream later, hosting a show about GitLab team members called Meet the Tanukis and steaming from time to time with team members about contributing to GitLab or making a Discord bot. Click the image to see some videos of my past livestreams.
